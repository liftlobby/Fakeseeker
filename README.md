# Getting Started with FakeSeeker (Easy Installation)

Welcome to FakeSeeker! This guide will help you download and run the application on your computer using a direct download link. No technical skills are required!

## What You Need:

- A Windows computer (This guide assumes Windows. Instructions for macOS or Linux may differ slightly).
- An internet connection (for the initial download).

## Steps:

1. Download the Application:

- Click on this link to go to the latest release page:
[Application Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r0HljX8CgbcKHxverT3ME_L2Mh6zD0qN/view?usp=sharing)

- Your web browser will open the link. Depending on your Google Drive link settings, you might see a preview or a direct download prompt.

- Look for a "Download" button or icon (often a downward arrow). Click it.

- If prompted, choose a location to save the file. Your browser's "Downloads" folder is the default location.

- The file you download will be named something like FakeSeeker_vX.Y.Z.zip **(the version number X.Y.Z might be different)**. Wait for the download to complete.

2. Extract the Application:

- Find the downloaded FakeSeeker_vX.Y.Z.zip file (usually in your "Downloads" folder).

- Right-click on the .zip file.

- Select "Extract All...".

- A window will pop up asking where to extract the files. Choose a location you'll remember, like your Desktop or Documents folder. It's best not to extract it directly into your Downloads folder. Click "Extract".

- This will create a new folder named FakeSeeker (or similar) in the location you chose.

3. Run FakeSeeker:

- Open the FakeSeeker folder that was just created.

- Inside this folder, find the file named FakeSeeker.exe.

- Double-click on **FakeSeeker.exe** to start the application.

- Windows Security Note: The first time you run it, Windows Defender SmartScreen might pop up a blue window saying "Windows protected your PC".

- Click on "More info".

- Then click on the "Run anyway" button that appears. This is normal for applications downloaded from the internet that aren't yet widely recognized by Microsoft.

4. Using the Application:

- The FakeSeeker window should now open.

- Use the buttons on the home screen or the sidebar (if visible) to:

- Upload Image/Video: Select a file from your computer to scan.

- Real-Time Detection: Use your camera or monitor your screen.

- View Scan History: See results from previous scans.

- Click the buttons to explore the different features.

5. Troubleshooting:

- "App Didn't Start": Make sure you extracted the entire FakeSeeker folder from the .zip file and are running the .exe from inside that extracted folder. Don't just pull the .exe out by itself.

- Antivirus Warning: Some antivirus programs might flag the .exe because it's a newly created application. This is often a false positive. If you trust the source, you may need to temporarily disable your antivirus or add an exception for FakeSeeker.exe. Proceed with caution if you are unsure.

- Model/Threshold Errors on First Run: The first time you run the app, it might try to download the latest detection model if you have an internet connection. If this fails, you might see an error. Please ensure you are connected to the internet and try restarting the application.

6. Enjoy using FakeSeeker!
