# Getting Started with FakeSeeker (Easy Installation)

Welcome to FakeSeeker! This guide will help you download and run the application on your computer. No technical skills are required!

## What You Need:

A Windows computer (This guide assumes Windows. Instructions for macOS or Linux may differ slightly).

An internet connection (for the initial download).

## Steps:

1. Download the Application:

- Click on this link to go to the latest release page:
[Appication Download](https://github.com/liftlobby/Fakeseeker/releases/tag/1.2.0)

- On the releases page, look for the "Assets" section.

- Download the file named FakeSeeker_vX.Y.Z.zip (the version number X.Y.Z might be different). Click on it to start the download.

2. Extract the Application:

- Find the downloaded FakeSeeker_vX.Y.Z.zip file (usually in your "Downloads" folder).

- Right-click on the .zip file.

- Select "Extract All...".

- A window will pop up asking where to extract the files. Choose a location you'll remember, like your Desktop or Documents folder. It's best not to extract it directly into your Downloads folder. Click "Extract".

- This will create a new folder named FakeSeeker (or similar) in the location you chose.

3. Run FakeSeeker:

- Open the FakeSeeker folder that was just created.

- Inside this folder, find the file named FakeSeeker.exe. It might have an icon you designed.
(Look for a file named "FakeSeeker" with Type "Application")

- Double-click on FakeSeeker.exe to start the application.

- Windows Security Note: The first time you run it, Windows Defender SmartScreen might pop up a blue window saying "Windows protected your PC".

- Click on "More info".

- Then click on the "Run anyway" button that appears. This is normal for applications downloaded from the internet that aren't yet widely recognized by Microsoft.

4. Using the Application:

- The FakeSeeker window should now open.

- Use the buttons on the home screen or the sidebar (if visible) to:

- Upload Image/Video: Select a file from your computer to scan.

- Real-Time Detection: Use your camera or monitor your screen.

- View Scan History: See results from previous scans.

- Follow the on-screen instructions for each feature.

5. Troubleshooting:

- "App Didn't Start": Make sure you extracted the entire FakeSeeker folder from the .zip file and are running the .exe from inside that extracted folder. Don't just pull the .exe out by itself.

- Antivirus Warning: Some antivirus programs might flag the .exe because it's a newly created application. This is often a false positive. If you trust the source, you may need to temporarily disable your antivirus or add an exception for FakeSeeker.exe. Proceed with caution if you are unsure.

- Model/Threshold Errors on First Run: The first time you run the app, it might try to download the latest detection model if you have an internet connection. If this fails, you might see an error. Please ensure you are connected to the internet and try restarting the application.

6. Enjoy using FakeSeeker!

Key things to customize:

[[Model](https://github.com/liftlobby/Fakeseeker/releases/tag/1.2.0)]: This is the most critical part. Replace this placeholder with the direct link to the releases page of your GitHub repository. Using /releases/latest usually points to the most recent one.

FakeSeeker_vX.Y.Z.zip: Adjust the filename example to match how you actually name your zipped distribution file on the releases page.

Operating System: If you provide builds for macOS or Linux, create separate, similar instructions mentioning .dmg/.app files for macOS or .tar.gz/AppImage/etc. for Linux and their respective extraction/running methods.
